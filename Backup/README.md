# Covid-19-Closure-Impact
Prior research into the efficacy of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) in containing the spread of Covid-19 indicate closures are the most effective containment policy for reducing COVID spread. The COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition and Department of Homeland Security designed a tool to examine the impacts of hospital capacity, PPE, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on fatality rates and the overwhelming of hospital facilities[1]. The tool provides a dashboard to examine predicting the affects of lifting various NPIs. The tool is useful to guiding decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. A continuation of this tool would allow for users to critically examine the efficacy of NPIs in future pandemic scenarios. While there will be specific nuances to future pandemics in terms of method and rate of spread, historically lock-down and travel restriction measures have been used as an NPI to combat pandemic spread. The analysis will allow a stakeholder to review the efficacy of various policy measures on COVID-19 infection rates (or proxy-rates), taking into consideration population density, socio-economic demographics and other key indicators.
