# COVID-19 Forecasting and Machine Learning Pipeline Visualization Tool

<insert edited description/project abstract here>

Please note: You need to run the pages on our R Shiny app in the order in which they appear on the sidebar (i.e. Overview & Data Ingestion then Data Merging then Data Pre-Processing then Feature Selection, etc.). Additionally, some of the processes running in the background of the app take a minute or so to load. Please allocate additional time for the Feature Selection, Generalized Linear Model, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting pages to run once you've clicked on the action buttons associated with these pages. 

**Our COVID-19 Forecasting and Machine Learning Pipeline Tool can be accessed at: https://tobijegede.shinyapps.io/covid19forecast/.**

If you would like to explore the underlying code for our R Shiny app, it can be found in this repository in the **"covid19forecast" folder in the app.R file.**



Prior research into the efficacy of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) in containing the spread of Covid-19 indicate closures are the most effective containment policy for reducing COVID spread. The COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition and Department of Homeland Security designed a tool to examine the impacts of hospital capacity, PPE, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on fatality rates and the overwhelming of hospital facilities[1]. The tool provides a dashboard to examine predicting the affects of lifting various NPIs. The tool is useful to guiding decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. A continuation of this tool would allow for users to critically examine the efficacy of NPIs in future pandemic scenarios. While there will be specific nuances to future pandemics in terms of method and rate of spread, historically lock-down and travel restriction measures have been used as an NPI to combat pandemic spread. The analysis will allow a stakeholder to review the efficacy of various policy measures on COVID-19 infection rates (or proxy-rates), taking into consideration population density, socio-economic demographics and other key indicators.
